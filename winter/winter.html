	<p class="justify">Leading up to my winter break was a series of preparing to move to our new place in San Mateo, this wouldn't have been such a big ordeal if I didn't get the flu
						on Christmas Eve. Work was relatively light as we put out our winter release and are preparing a major tech overhaul, it's still in the calm of the storm phase
						so we're relatively calm until the release date.</p>

			I was able to get out of bed the day after Christmas from the flu which was a day before we got the keys to our new place. I was supposed to have 4 days to move from one 
			place to the next which ended up just barely working out. After that I would have two days to get things set up here before I took a trip to Tel Aviv Israel for a week. 
			</p>
			<p class="justify">
			Turns out not resting after getting the flu is quite unadvised so I ended up catching an infection in my lungs which put me right back in bed for most of the day. I ended 
			up missing out on ny flight and am waiting in town to recover. I should have gone through enough antibiotics and cough medicine to be good to come back to teach shortly.

			I picked up the Final Fantasy 14 expansion Shadowbringers when it launched thoughouly enjoyed the story from start to finish. I've been gearing myself to be able to main tank 
			end game raids but need others to get on my level so we can run more. I hope to run some of the content solo or with a friend once I get my new place set up. Apart from FF14 
			I've played some Nioh, Rainbown Six Siege, and random games here and there.

			Nothing particuarly special this season that stands out, but I've been keeping up with various shows that ended this season. I think Dr. Stone was a pretty decent even though 
			the beginning was pretty boring. I watched a few other trash anime which were alright, but nothing to write home about or be worth mentioning. I just realized a few days ago that 
			Sword Art Online had a new season so I'll catch up on that over the next week weeks.
